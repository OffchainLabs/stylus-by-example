# **DelegateCall**

## Introduction

Delegate calls are a powerful feature in smart contract development, allowing a contract to execute code from another contract while maintaining its own context. In Rust Stylus smart contracts, we have a `delegatecall` function similar to Solidity's, serving as a low-level operation akin to a regular call.

When Contract A executes a `delegatecall` to Contract B, B's code runs using Contract A's storage, `msg.sender`, and `msg.value`. This means any state changes affect Contract A, and the original sender and value of the transaction are preserved.

Understanding delegate calls in Rust Stylus is essential for building modular smart contracts. This document explores how delegate calls work in Rust Stylus.

## **Delegate Calls in Rust Stylus Smart Contracts**

Delegate calls allow a contract to execute code from another contract while keeping its own context, including storage, `msg.sender`, and `msg.value`. In Rust Stylus smart contracts, delegate calls can be defined in two ways:

1. Using the low-level `delegate_call` function.
2. Using `RawCall` with the `new_delegate()` configuration.

## 1. Using the Low-Level `delegate_call` Function

The `delegate_call` function is a low-level operation similar to `call` and `static_call`. It is considered unsafe because it requires trusting the external contract to maintain safety. The function signature is as follows:

```rust
pub unsafe fn delegate_call(
    context: impl MutatingCallContext,
    to: Address,
    data: &[u8],
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error>
```

### Safety Considerations

- **Trust Requirement**: The calling contract must trust the external contract to uphold safety requirements.
- **Storage Modification**: The external contract can arbitrarily change the calling contract's storage.
- **Ether Spending**: It may spend ether or perform other critical operations.
- **Cache Clearing**: While this function clears any cached values, it doesn't prevent unsafe actions by the external contract.

### Example Usage

Here's how to use `delegate_call` in a smart contract:

```rust
pub fn low_level_delegate_call(
    &mut self,
    calldata: Vec<u8>,
    target: Address,
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, DelegateCallErrors> {
    unsafe {
        let result = delegate_call(self, target, &calldata)
            .map_err(|_| DelegateCallErrors::DelegateCallFailed(DelegateCallFailed {}))?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The function `low_level_delegate_call` performs an unsafe delegate call to the `target` contract with the provided `calldata`.
- It handles errors by mapping them to a custom `DelegateCallErrors` type.
- The use of `unsafe` highlights the need for caution when using this function.

## 2. Using `RawCall` with `new_delegate()` Configuration

For scenarios requiring untyped calls to another contract, `RawCall` offers a configurable and fluent method. You can set up an unsafe delegate call by chaining optional configuration methods, similar to configuring a `File` in Rust.

### Example Usage

Here's how to use `RawCall` to perform a delegate call:

```rust
pub fn raw_delegate_call(
    &mut self,
    calldata: Vec<u8>,
    target: Address,
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>> {
    let data = RawCall::new_delegate() // Configure a delegate call
        .gas(2100)                     // Supply 2100 gas
        .limit_return_data(0, 32)      // Only read the first 32 bytes back
        .call(target, &calldata)?;

    Ok(data)
}
```

In this example:

- `RawCall::new_delegate()` initializes a new delegate call configuration.
- The `gas(2100)` method sets the gas limit for the call.
- `limit_return_data(0, 32)` limits the returned data to the first 32 bytes.
- The `call` method executes the delegate call to the `target` address with the provided `calldata`.
