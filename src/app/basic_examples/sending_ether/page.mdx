# Sending Ether

We have two main ways to send Ether in Rust Stylus. Using `transfer_eth` method or using `call`. Note that `transfer_eth` method invokes the other contract, which may in turn call others. All gas is supplied, which the recipient may burn. If this is not desired, the call function may be used instead.

so these two are exactly equivalent:

```rust
transfer_eth(recipient, value)?;                 

call(Call::new().value(value), recipient, &[])?;
```

where to send:
1. EOA Addresses
2. Solidity smart contracts with receive (no calldata)
3. Solidity smart contracts with fallback (with calldata)
4. Stylus contracts with the payable methods

```rust

#![no_std]
extern crate alloc;

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: wee_alloc::WeeAlloc = wee_alloc::WeeAlloc::INIT;

use alloc::vec;
use alloc::vec::Vec;

use stylus_sdk::alloy_primitives::Address;
use stylus_sdk::prelude::*;
use stylus_sdk::storage::StorageAddress;

// Consts must be 'static, so Rust primitives work well
// Addresses are 20 bytes long, this one is 'checksummed'
const OWNER: &str = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045";

#[solidity_storage]
#[entrypoint]
pub struct Contract {
    owner: StorageAddress,
}

#[external]
impl Contract {
    // Sets the owner to the OWNER const set above
    pub fn init(&mut self) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        // Parse the const hex &str as a local Address variable
        let owner_address = Address::parse_checksummed(OWNER, None).expect("Invalid address");

        // Save the result as the owner
        self.owner.set(owner_address);

        Ok(())
    }

    // Returns the current owner
    pub fn owner(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        let owner_address = self.owner.get();

        Ok(owner_address)
    }
}
